# Overall
Overall my solution was very similar to the instructor solution

## select_instructions
My solution was nearly identical to the instructor solution save some formatting differences.

## print_x86
My solution was very similar to the instructor solution, except I didn't implement several of the arg cases that weren't needed for the scope of the assignment. I also implemented the beginning and ending instructions of the program in ast and processed them like the other instructions.
